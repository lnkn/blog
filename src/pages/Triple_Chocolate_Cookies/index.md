#### Prep time: 15 minutes | Bake time: 13 minutes | Total time: 28 minutes

## Ingredients

#### The Cookie
- 4 ounces **good quality milk chocolate**, chopped
- 4 ounces **semisweet chocolate**
- 1 stick **unsalted butter**
- 1 1/4 cups **granulated sugar**
- 2 **large eggs**

- 1/2 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1/2 teaspoon **baking powder**

## Instructions
1. Set the oven to 325°F and set aside a non-stick cookie sheet. Melt the 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate wit the butter on low heat in a small pot. Make sure to stir consistently and remove from heat once all melted. Allow to cool for a few minutes. 

2. Then, in a large mixing bowl add the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Pour chocolate mixture on top and stir together for about a minute. Scrape the sides down and then add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients, making sure all ingredients are incorporated. Gently fold in the chopped milk chocolate until evenly mixed in. 

3. With your hands, form the chocolate dough into 1 1/2 tablespoon size balls. Bakes for about 13 minutes, until the top of the cookies crack. Let cool on cookie sheet for five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool an additional five minutes.
