## The Recipe

#### Yields: 1 9"x5" loaf 

#### Prep time: 10 minutes | Bake time: 55 minutes | Total time: 1 hour 5 minutes

## Ingredients

#### The Loaf
- 1/4 cup **virgin unrefined coconut oil**, melted 
- 1/4 cup **honey**
- 2 1/2 tablespoons **coconut sugar**
- 2 **large eggs**
- 1 cup mashed **ripe bananas**, about 3 medium bananas
- 1/4 cup **milk**
- 1 tablespoon **vanilla extract**
- 1 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1 teaspoon **cinnamon**
- 1/4 teaspoon **salt**
- 1 3/4 cups **white whole wheat flour**
- **Chocolate chunks**, optional

## Instructions
1. Set oven to 325°F and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan.

2. In a large bowl, whisk coconut oil, honey and coconut sugar together. Add eggs and whisk ingredients together. Next, mix in the mashed bananas and milk. 

3. Add the vanilla, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Whisk together into the wet ingredients. Then, add 1 cup of the flour and whisk into the wet ingredients. Next, using a spatula, add the flour a quarter cup at a time until the flour is just incorporated. 

4. Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan and evenly spread it out. Sprinkle the chocolate chunks on top and bake for 55-60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the loaf comes out clean. 

5. Let the bread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes until taking out of pan. Then transfer to wire rack to cool an additional 15 minutes before slicing.
