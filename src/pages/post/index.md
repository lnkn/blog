# Apple Crisp

*This apple crisp was such a hit at two Thanksgiving dinners this past week! The top of the crisp is so deliciously full of oats and is the perfect ratio to apple. You’ll want to add this to the holiday baking list!*

## Ingredients:
- 4 **Honeycrisp apples**
- 2 **Granny Smith apples**
- 2 sticks **unsalted butter**, softened 
- 1 cup **brown sugar**
- 1 ¼ cup **old-fashioned oats**
- 1 cup all-purpose **flour**
- 1 teaspoon **granulated sugar**
- 2 teaspoons ground **cinnamon**

## Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Slice the apples into ¼ cm and add to a 13”x9” glass pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon and the granulated sugar on top of the apples and mix together. Then make sure the apples are evenly spread out.

In a large bowl, add butter, brown sugar, oats and flour into bowl.  Use a fork to cut the butter in the flour mixture (or your hands!) and combine, making sure all the butter is crumbly and small. Then, add crumble mixture to the top of the apples and flatten down the mixture. 

Bake for 55 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Once out of the oven, let sit for 5 minutes and serve warm!
