Jumping on the citrus train with these deliciously Baked Cara Cara Orange Donuts! These light orange zested donuts are perfect for a weekend brunch or just because. 

## The Recipe

#### Yields: 8 citrus donuts

#### Prep time: 15 minutes | Bake time: 9 minutes | Total time: 24 minutes

## Ingredients

#### The Donut
- 1 cup **all-purpose flour**
- 3/4 teaspoon **baking powder**
- 1/4 teaspoon **salt**
- 1/3 cup **granulated sugar**
- 1/3 cup **milk**
- 1 **large egg**
- 2 tablespoons **butter**, melted and cooled
- 1 **Cara Cara orange**, juiced
- 1 **Cara Cara orange**, zested
- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract**

#### The Glaze:
- 1 cup **powdered sugar**
- 2 1/2 tablespoons **milk**

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Spray your donut pan with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. 

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, milk, egg, butter, orange juice, orange zest and vanilla. Pour wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until all ingredients are just incorporated. Spoon the batter into the cavities of the donut pan, making sure to only fill 3/4 worth.  The batter should be spread evenly between eight cavities. 

Bake for about 9 minutes or until edges start to slightly brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about five minutes. Then, place on cooling rack to cool an additional 10 minutes. 

While the donuts are cooling, in a small shallow bowl make the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and milk. Once the donuts are completely cool, dip the donuts into the glaze and top with an orange slice!
