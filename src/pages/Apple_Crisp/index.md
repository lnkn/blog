#### Prep time: 20 mimutes | Bake time: 55 minutes | Total time: 1 hour and 15 minutes

#### Yields: 1 apple crisp

## Ingredients:

- 4 **Honey Crisp** apples
- 2 **Granny Smith** apples
- 1 cup **unsalted butter**, softened 
- 1 cup **brown sugar**
- 1 1/4 cup **old fashioned oats**
- 1 cup **all-purpose flour**
- 1 teaspoon **granulated sugar**
- 2 teaspoons **ground cinnamon**


## Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350°F. Slice the apples into 1/4 cm and add to a 13”x9” glass pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon and  granulated sugar on top of the apples and mix together. Then, make sure the apples are evenly spread out. 

In a large bowl, add butter, brown sugar, oats and flour into bowl. Use a fork to cut the butter in the flour mixture (or your hands!) and combine, making sure all the butter is crumbly and small. Then, add crumble mixture to the top of the apples and flatten down the mixture. 

Bake for 55 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Let sit for five minutes and dig in! Oh, and don't forget the vanilla ice cream!
