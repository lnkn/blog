I just love Spring and all that it brings: sunshine, berries, longer days, and so much more. These Raspberry Lemon Scones are going to have to become a baking tradition in my house each spring. They have the perfect balance of lemon and fruit, all wrapped up into a soft and fluffy scone.

## The Recipe
### April 7, 2019

#### Yields: 12 scones

#### Prep time: 30 minutes | Bake time: 20 minutes | Total time: 50 minutes


## Ingredients
#### The Scone:
- 3 1/2 cups **all-purpose flour**
- 2/3 cup **granulated sugar**
- 1 tablespoon **baking powder**
- 1/2 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1/4 **salt**
- 2 **lemons**, zested
- 1 stick **unsalted butter**, cut into cubes
- 2 **eggs**
- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract**
- 2 teaspoons **lemon juice**
- 1 cup **heavy cream**
- 1 cup **fresh raspberries**

#### The Glaze: 
- 3 teaspoons **lemon juice**
- 1 tablespoon **milk**
- 1 cup **powdered sugar**

Instructions:
1. Set oven to 400ËšF and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest. Then, add cubes of butter and with your hands combine flour mixture and butter together, until butter pieces are about the size of a pea (its okay is there some larger pieces too).
3. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, lemon juice, and heavy cream. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture, and with a spatula stir until combined. Continue to stir ingredients until the dough starts to form large clumps. Add a teaspoon of water if the dough seems dry. Then, fold in raspberries gently. 
4. Place dough a lightly floured surface and form into a ball, pat down to a square shape. Fold the right half of the dough over the left half. Repeat this step two-three times, the raspberries will start bleeding into the dough. Lightly pat the dough down to form the dough into a 1-2 inch thick rectangle. Next, with a serrated knife cut the dough lengthwise. Then cut each half into six scones, equaling 12 scones total. 
5. Place six scones onto each prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with the melted butter and sprinkle with derma sugar.
6. Baking one sheet at a time, bake scones for 18-20 minutes, until the tops are golden. Once scones are done baking, allow to cool on sheet for five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool for an additional 10 minutes. When the scones are cooling, make your glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, lemon juice and milk until smooth. Drizzle glaze over the scones to complete.
