*Have you ever taken a bite of something and you were transported back to a childhood memory? These cookies do just that.  With the perfect amount of sprinkles, sugar, and vanilla; these soft and chewy cookies will be your new go to. Bake a batch (or two) and enjoy!*

#### Prep Time: 15 min | Bake time: 10 min | Total time: 25 minutes

**Yields: 18 cookies** 

## What you'll need:

- 10 tablespoons **unsalted butter**, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup **granulated sugar**
- 1/3 cup **brown sugar** 
- 1 tablespoon **vanilla extract**
- 1 **large egg**
- 1 3/4 cups **all-purpose flour**
- 1 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1/4 teaspoon **salt** 
- 1/2 teaspoon **cream of tartar**
- 1/2 cup **rainbow sprinkles**

## Instructions:

Set the oven to 350°F and grab your non-stick cookie sheet. 

In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter, sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed for about one minute. Add the vanilla and egg, mixing together until incorporated. Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and cream of tartar. Mixing slow and ensuring all the ingredients are combined. Add the sprinkles and mix slow until combined. 

Form the cookies with your hands in 1 ½ tablespoon size balls. Place on the baking sheet a couple inches apart. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cookies begin to crack on the top a bit. Set aside to cool for about five minutes before removing to a cookie rack.
