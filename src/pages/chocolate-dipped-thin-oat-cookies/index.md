We are facing a huge snow storm in Seattle right now and they are calling it "Snowmageddon". So while you are stuck inside staying warm I suggest baking these delicious Chocolate Dipped Thin Oat Cookies.

## The Recipe
### February 9, 2019

#### Yields: 30 oat cookies

#### Prep time: 8 minutes | Bake time: 8 minutes | Total time: 16 minutes

## Ingredients
#### The Cookie
- 2/3 stick **unsalted butter**
- 2 tablespoons **honey**
- 2 tablespoons **milk**
- 1/3 cup **all-purpose flour**
- 1/3 cup **old fashioned oats**
- 1/3 cup **granulated sugar**
- 1/4 teaspoon **baking powder**
- 1/4 teaspoon **vanilla extract**
- 5 ounces **dark chocolate**
- Flaky **sea salt**

## Instructions

1. Set the oven to 350Â°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 

2. In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and whisk in honey and milk. 

3. Then, in a medium bowl stir together the flour, oats, sugar and baking powder. Pour butter mixture and vanilla into the dry ingredients. Stir until well combined, the mixture will be a bit gooey. 

4. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of the dough onto the parchment paper, making sure there is plenty of space between each cookie. Bake for about 7-9 minutes or until cookies are browned around the edges. Remove from oven and let cool for about five minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 

5. While the cookies are cooling, melt the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl (I microwave for 20 seconds, stir and repeat until completely melted). Brush half of each cookie with the melted chocolate and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.
